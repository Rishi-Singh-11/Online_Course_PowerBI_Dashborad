Online Courses Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains an analysis of online course data for an EdTech startup aiming to grow its offerings in recorded lectures. The analysis is presented in a Power BI dashboard that provides insights into various aspects of course performance, including category-wise trends, viewer preferences, and instructor effectiveness.



Problem Statement

The EdTech startup needs to leverage insights from the data collected from various EdTech websites to enhance their recorded lecture services. The goal is to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth, with an emphasis on category-wise analysis. Below are the key objectives:

Objectives:

Course Types Distribution:

Examine the distribution of course types (e.g., courses, specializations, professional certificates) across categories.

Count the number of courses by category and sub-category to uncover trends and align offerings with learner demand.

Viewer Engagement:

Calculate the average number of views for each category, sub-category, and language to provide insights into engagement patterns.

Language Distribution:

Analyze the distribution of languages in which courses are created.

Language Preferences:

Determine language preferences for the top 5 categories based on viewer preferences to optimize course accessibility.

Subtitle Impact:

Investigate the relationship between subtitle availability and the number of views to understand its impact on engagement and accessibility.

Top Instructors:

Identify the top three instructors for each category and sub-category based on ratings to highlight high-quality educators.

Course Duration Analysis:

Examine the relationship between course duration and the number of views to understand how course length influences engagement. Adjust for flexible schedules by considering monthly limits (e.g., 60 hours per month) and total flexible timings (e.g., 200 hours).

Key Insights from the Dashboard:
